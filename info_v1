				The Alpha Club is a book club situated in Tawa College, run by Lars Humphries <br>
				We are currently reviewing The Tempest, by William Shakespeare. <br> <br>
				The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare,probably written in 1610–1611, and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone. <br>
				After the first scene, which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest, the rest of the story is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, <br>
				a complex and contradictory character, lives with his daughter Miranda, and his two servants—Caliban,
				a savage monster figure, and Ariel, an airy spirit. <br>
				The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island.
				It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. <br>
				In Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play,
				and contributes spectacle, allegory, and elevated language.
